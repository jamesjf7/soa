<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The topic that we take for our SOA course project is an application to get to know more details about the content in food. This is considered quite useful during the current pandemic because to achieve a healthy and good body condition, one of the main factors that increase our antibodies is food. With our program, we hope that users can find out information about a food they eat every day and also maybe be inspired in making healthier food for them.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we must improve our immune system, which is the body's defense against bacteria, viruses and disease-causing organisms that we may touch, consume and breathe on a daily basis. Although there are no foods that can prevent COVID-19 infection, maintaining a healthy, balanced diet is very important in boosting a good immune system. Increasing endurance is one of the keys to not contracting the COVID-19 virus.
